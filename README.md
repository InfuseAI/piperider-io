# Piperider v2

A rebuilt version of the Piperider website using code. The previous website used Webflow and was a damn pain to edit. This is subjective of course, but it seemed that a code-based website would actually be more productive for Infuse, since almost everyone is technical.

It is up to you whether or not you want to use this code. I created it as an alternative to the current website and as a proof of concept. No expectation that you guys take the webflow site down.

## Relevant Tech this is built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) (i.e. React)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)

## Getting started

To get started with this template, first install the npm dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.
